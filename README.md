# Password Generator

This is a simple password generator implemented in Python. It generates strong, random passwords based on the specified criteria.

- Optionally include uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.
- Ensure at least one character from each selected category is included.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

No external libraries are required. This script uses only the standard Python library.

## Usage

You can use the `password_generator` function to generate a password with the desired criteria.
